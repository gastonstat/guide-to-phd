@cr-phd1
| Imagine a circle that contains all of human knowledge.

@cr-phd2
| By the time you finish elementary school, you know a little.

@cr-phd3
| By the time you finish high school, you know a bit more.

@cr-phd4
| With a bachelor's degree, you gain a specialty.

@cr-phd5
| A master's degree deepens that specialty.

@cr-phd6
| Reading research papers takes you to the edge of human knowledge.

@cr-phd7
| Once you're at the boundary, you focus.

[@cr-phd8]{scale-by="1.5"}
| You push at the boundary for a few years.

[@cr-phd9]{scale-by="1.5"}
| Until one day, the boundary gives way.

[@cr-phd10]{scale-by="1.5"}
| And, that dent you've made is called a Ph.D.

[@cr-phd11]{scale-by="1.4"}
| Of course, the world looks different to you now.

@cr-phd12
| So, don't forget the bigger picture.
